# Chat-App

The Java Console Chat Application is a basic one-on-one messaging system built using Java Sockets and Multithreading. It enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a server and a client via the command-line interface. This project demonstrates foundational concepts in network programming, input/output handling, and thread-based concurrency in Java.
